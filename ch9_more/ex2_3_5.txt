2.  
    My hypothesis:

    "Hello from inside the execute method!" 
    => execute
    
    It actually printed nothing, because the block was nevr activated with .call
    It did return a Proc object: => #<Proc:0x00000000d8cd68@(irb):5> 
    


3.  Exception handling solves the problem of errors that come up when working with real-world 
    users and files. It makes it possible for the program to still work.
    
    
5.  The message tells us that something went wrong when line 5 tried to reference line 1. 
    The computer thought execute was being called with 0 arguments when it expected 1. 
    The problem is that for a block to be accepted as an argument, the method definition needs 
    "&" before the local variable for the block.
