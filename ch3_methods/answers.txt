Exercise 2:

  1. 2
  2. nil
  3. nil      Oops. Correct answer is "Joe". Unlike puts, p returns the value of whatever it printed out. Can be string or other class of object.
  4. "four"
  5. error    Oops. I thought the computer would be thrown off by this syntax. Instead it just returned nil.
  

Exercise 4:

I think it will return either the value of the expression evaluated just above the line "return", which would be
"Yipeee!!!", or it may return nil because there is nothing following the keyword "return".
  
I tested; it returns nil and prints nothing on the screen.


Exercise 5:

-----

def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
  puts words
end

scream("Yippeee")

-----

Prints "Yippeee!!!!" and return value is nil (as the result of puts).


Exercise 6:

The method 'calculate_product' in line 1 expected 2 arguments but only received 1.
